# reservation commitments

  Node at hop, commits to:
    - settle (irrevocably issue/credit the funds) if:
      - it has not yet canceled the transaction.
      - it is presented with the lock.
      - node at hop-1 has made the same commitment.
    - cancel the transaction if:
      - it has not yet settled the transaction.
      - node at hop+1 has canceled.
